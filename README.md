## Core
1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
   1. Chainlink Price Feed
   2. Set a function to exchange ETH and BTC -> $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   1. People can only mint stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC

## Health Factor - Liquidation
- calculate health factor function
- set health factor if debt is 0
- added a bunch of view function

## Fuzz test
1. What are our invariants/properties

## Extra
1. Some proper oracle use
2. Write more tests
3. Smart Contract Audit Preparation
